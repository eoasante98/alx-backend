# Caching

## Background Context
In this project, we'll learn different caching algorithms

## Resources
**Read or watch:**
- [Cache replacement policies - FIFO](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/fjhr6EvFeF3mWwsPQXUKdQ)
- [Cache replacement policies - LIFO](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/U44RQjXp8xBtsbNIyhHIyw)
- [Cache replacement policies - LRU](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/gKerxvR4dnXQYkBX2ujZiQ)
- [Cache replacement policies - MRU](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Tmk4qEBZ7QTknvbpKabWfQ)
- [Cache replacement policies - LFU](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/8PEJ8L34bxhL2y--BW5zGQ)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I'm expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of google:
- What a caching system is
- What FIFO means
- What LIFO means
- What LRU means
- What MRU means
- What LRU means
- What is the purpose of a caching system
- What limits a caching system have
